Feature List

Basic Raytracing Features. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

(a) Camera
    I have fully implemented the Camera object. I have demonstrated it working fully for binary and
    blinn-phong renders using the test suite provided (binary_scene.ppm, binary.ppm, mirror_image.ppm, 
    phong_scene.ppm and simple_phong.ppm).

(b) Intersection tests
    I have fully implemented intersection tests for spheres, cylinders and triangles.  I have demonstrated it 
    working fully for binary and blinn-phong renders using the test suite provided (binary_scene.ppm, binary.ppm,
    mirror_image.ppm, phong_scene.ppm and simple_phong.ppm).

(c) Blinn-Phong shading 
    I have fully implemented Blinn-Phong shading. I have demonstrated it working (albeit with some bugs),
    using the test suite provided (mirror_image.ppm, phong_scene.ppm and simple_phong.ppm).

(d) Shadows
    I have fully implemented shadows within the Blinn-Phong shader. I have demonstrated it working 
    using the test suite provided (mirror_image.ppm, phong_scene.ppm and simple_phong.ppm).

(e) Tone mapping 
    I have implemented linear tone mapping. I have demonstrated it through the test suite provided 
    (mirror_image.ppm, phong_scene.ppm and simple_phong.ppm).

(f) Reflection 
    I have implemented reflection. I have demonstrated reflections through the test suite provided 
    (mirror_image.ppm and phong_scene.ppm).

(g) Refraction 
    I have partially implemented refraction, and have not demonstrated this feature through the test suite.



2. Intermediate raytracer features. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

(a) Textures
    I have fully implemented textures for spheres and triangles, and partially implemented textures for cylinder. I have demonstrated
    this feature through texture.ppm and simple_phong_with_texture.ppm, both of which are listed in "Resources".

(b) Acceleration hierarchy
    I began implementing this feature, but was not able to complete it before the submission deadline.
    My work-in-progress code for the acceleration hierarchy can be found in box.h.



3. Pathtracer . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

(a) Pixel sampling
    I did not implement this feature.

(b) Lens sampling
    I did not implement this feature.

(c) BRDF sampling
    I did not implement this feature.

(d) Light sampling 
    I did not implement this feature.
